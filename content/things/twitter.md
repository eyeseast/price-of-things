Elon Musk, Twitter’s most important shitposter, has added the company to his
business empire after months of legal skirmishes, according to CNBC, The
Washington Post, and Insider. The acquisition was confirmed in an SEC filing
from the company on Friday morning, noting it’s delisting $TWTR from the New
