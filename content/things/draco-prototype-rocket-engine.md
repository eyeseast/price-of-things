> The DRACO engine would consist of a nuclear reactor that would heat hydrogen
> from a chilly minus 420 degrees Fahrenheit to a toasty 4,400 degrees, with
> the hot gas shooting from a nozzle to generate thrust. Greater fuel
> efficiency could speed up journeys to Mars, reducing the amount of time
> astronauts spend exposed to the treacherous environment of deep space.
