From Politico:

> Any stepped-up U.S. demand for Tomahawks — a ship- and submarine-launched missile that can hit targets 1,000 miles away, according to RTX — would come as allies are seeking them too. On Thursday, the Japanese government announced a $2.5 billion deal for 400 Tomahawks that will be delivered between 2025 and 2027. In August, Australia inked a similar deal for 200 missiles.
>
> The Marine Corps requested 34 Tomahawks for $1.9 million apiece in fiscal 2024, while the Navy is spending $4.5 million to $9.8 million for the Standard Missile.
